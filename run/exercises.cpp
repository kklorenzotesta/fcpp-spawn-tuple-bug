/**
 * EXERCISES:
 *
 * Expand the MAIN function below to compute the following:
 *
 * 1)    The number of neighbour devices.
 *
 * 2)    The maximum number of neighbour devices ever witnessed by the current device.
 *
 * 3)    The maximum number of neighbour devices ever witnessed by any device in the network.
 *
 * 4)    Move towards the neighbour with the lowest number of neighbours.
 *
 * Every exercise above is designed to help solving the following one.
 *
 * In order to check whether what you computed is correct, you may display the computed
 * quantities as node qualities through tags `node_color`, `node_size` and `node_shape`.
 * You can also save your computed quantities in additional specific node attributes:
 * towards this end, you should both add a tag in namespace tags above, then list it
 * (together with the corresponding data type) in the `tuple_store` option below.
 *
 *
 * BONUS EXERCISES:
 *
 * 5)    Move away from the neighbour with the highest number of neighbours.
 *
 * 6)    Move as if the device was attracted by the neighbour with the lowest number of neighbours,
 *       and repulsed by the neighbour with the highest number of neighbours.
 *
 * 7)    Move as if the device was repulsed by every neighbour, and by the four walls of the
 *       rectangular box between points [0,0] and [500,500].
 *
 * HINTS:
 *
 * -    In the first few exercises, start by reasoning on when/where to use `nbr` (collecting from
 *      neighbours) and `old` (collecting from the past).
 *
 * -    In order to move a device, you need to set a velocity vector through something like
 *      `node.velocity() = make_vec(0,0)`.
 *
 * -    Coordinates are available through `node.position()`. Coordinates can be composed as physical
 *      vectors: `[1,3] + [2,-1] == [3,2]`, `[2,4] * 0.5 == [1,2]`.
 *
 * -    In the last two exercises, you can model attraction/repulsion using the classical inverse square law.
 *      More precisely, if `v` is the vector between two objects, the resulting force is `v / |v|^3` where
 *      `|v| = sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2)`. In FCPP, `norm(v)` is available for computing `|v|`.
